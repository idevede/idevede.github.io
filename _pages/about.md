Defu Cao /dəfu: tsaʊ/ is a Ph.D. student in the [Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://homeadmin.usc.edu/www/), working with [Prof. Yan Liu](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~liu32/) at the USC [Melady Lab](https://melady.usc.edu). He is also working with [Prof. Angela Zhou](https://angelamzhou.github.io/) from USC Marshall Data Sciences and Operations.

Prior, he earned his Master's Degree at the School of EECS [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), where he was co-advised by [Prof. Xu Cheng](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/info/1499/6782.htm) and [Prof. Xianhua Liu](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/info/1499/6779.htm).

Cao's research primarily focuses on developing advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms for structured data, with a particular emphasis on time series foundation models. His work aims to create models that demonstrate a deep understanding of temporal patterns and dynamics in various domains, including spatio-temporal and relational data. To this end, his research aims to integrate causal inference, graph neural networks, spectral domain representation, interpretability, and robustness.

In addition, he is also interested in causal representation learning and pre-training large language models. He has published his research in top conference proceedings including NeurIPS, CVPR, ICLR, ICRA, ICDM, and NAACL.
